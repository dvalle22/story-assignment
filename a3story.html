                There once was a frog named Grof.
                He's usually happy and jumping around.

                But one day he got sad because he was hungry.
                He searched and searched but couldn't find anything to eat around him.

            <p>
                Suddenly, in the distance he spotted something that looked like a swarm of flies...
                However, he searched so much that his hope had fallen greatly.
                Regardless, he went to check it out.
